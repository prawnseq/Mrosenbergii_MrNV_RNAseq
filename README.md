## About
This pipeline was used for the transcriptome assembly and differential expression analysis of M.rosenbergii in response to MrNV infection. The pipeline was written using **[Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)** tool. The pipeline contained three major sections including raw data pre-processing, transcriptome assembly, and post-processing of the transcriptome.
